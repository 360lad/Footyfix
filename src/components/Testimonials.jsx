            <Testimonial paragraph="Being an Insightful Player is an opportunity 
            to get out there and tell a positive story rather than the negative ones
             that sometimes get told. Kids hear me and relate to me; maybe something Iâ€™ve 
             been going through can help them learn that tough times donâ€™t
              last; tough people do. â€¦. Insightful Player is doing a great job
               of reaching a lot of kids and by reaching out to Footyfix players who have 
                              been there and done a lot of things. Kids can learn a lot from 
               the Insightful Player initiative."
